# DataVizWork
## Code and final project RMD for data visualization class (DSA5200-Merrimack College).
Project focused on deriving elegant ggplot2 visualizations to explore gender-based salary discrepancies amongst various college majors.

The visualizations explored the potential earnings power for those graduating with STEM (Science Technology, Engineering and Math) degrees. Not surprisingly, those graduating with these degrees tended to have higher starting salaries. Interestingly, the gender bias of starting salary was also highly evident for STEM degree recipients. The most lucrative STEM degree, Engineering, was male dominated, while the least lucrative STEM degrees, Health/Biology, were female dominated. The accepted reasoning for this is the concept of valuative bias, where society unfairly characterizes female-dominated professions as less valuable.
